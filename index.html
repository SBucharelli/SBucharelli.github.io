            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a frontend/UX engineer who enjoys building interfaces that feel clear, intuitive, and genuinely
                helpful. I work
                mostly with React, React Native, and TypeScript across iOS, Android, and web, and I care a lot about
                creating
                consistent patterns and small touches that make an experience feel polished.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most recently, I worked as the UX Engineer on the IndeVets mobile team. I naturally fell into that
                “in-between”
                space — refining design details, asking clarifying questions, filling in gaps, and making sure our
                interaction
                patterns were both usable and realistic to implement. I also architected our cross-platform component
                library,
                which helped the mobile and web teams stay aligned as the product grew.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although I was primarily embedded on the mobile team, I also partnered closely with the staffing team. I
                built
                components for their project, reviewed designs, and worked through interaction details when they needed
                support.
                Contributing to both areas gave me a broader understanding of how the product fit together and helped
                keep branding
                and expectations aligned across teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my favorite parts of the role was being someone the team trusted. I loved when engineers told me
                my
                components felt “plug and play,” or when someone asked me to join a feature review because something
                looked off
                visually. I also really valued being in early conversations—helping keep the user’s needs front and
                center and adding the small UX details that make the experience feel thoughtful rather than stressful.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something I care deeply about is reducing cognitive load for the people who use the products I help
                build. At
                IndeVets, that meant thinking about the vets behind the screen — people already juggling long shifts,
                medical
                decisions, and emotional labor. I wanted the UI to feel calm, clear, and easy to navigate, not
                overwhelming or
                flashy. Good UX should meet people where they are, respect their time and mental energy, and make their
                day a little
                lighter.

                <h3>IndeVets Mobile Application</h3>
                <p class="tech">React Native, TypeScript, React Query, React Navigation, Reanimated, styled-components
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    I joined IndeVets right as the mobile app was starting to take shape. A couple of months after I
                    arrived, the
                    project
                    transitioned from a contract team to a small internal group of four of us. We were all building the
                    app together,
                    which meant I had the chance to work on many of the early components and patterns. Being there so
                    early gave me a
                    unique view of how everything evolved, and it shaped the way I approached UI clarity and consistency
                    as the product
                    grew.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the things I appreciated most about working on the IndeVets app was designing for real
                    people. Veterinarians
                    carry a huge emotional and mental load in their day-to-day work, so I tried to make the parts of the
                    app they used
                    feel simple, gentle, and easy to process. Good UX should make someone’s day feel a little lighter,
                    and that idea
                    became a guiding principle for me.
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Built core parts of the app:</strong> Developed many foundational components and screens
                        early on,
                        which later became the base for new features. It was rewarding to see how those pieces grew and
                        evolved over
                        time.</li>

                    <li><strong>Created the cross-platform UI library:</strong> Designed and implemented IndeVets-CUI, a
                        shared
                        library with tokens, theming, and 30+ reusable components used across both mobile and web. This
                        made building
                        new UI faster and more consistent for the whole team.</li>

                    <li><strong>Supported design handoff and clarity:</strong> Reviewed Figma files, asked clarifying
                        questions,
                        caught inconsistencies, and suggested small interaction improvements when something felt unclear
                        or incomplete.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Availability Calendar:</strong> Built a complex scheduling interface with three-state
                        day selection,
                        pay-period logic, blackout rules, and real-time syncing through React Query. It was one of the
                        most
                        challenging and interesting features I worked on.</li>

                    <li><strong>Shift browsing & booking:</strong> Implemented workflows for exploring shifts,
                        filtering, viewing
                        details, favoriting, and booking — including UI support for pay-rate calculations.</li>

                    <li><strong>Focus on UX quality:</strong> Even when I wasn’t making final design choices, I
                        continuously looked for
                        opportunities to improve spacing, accessibility, behavior, and consistency. Those small details
                        add up.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="project-description">
                    As the UX Engineer on the mobile team, I worked closely with design, product, team leads, backend
                    engineers,
                    and other frontend engineers to shape how new features should look and feel.
                    I refined patterns,
                    asked
                    clarifying questions, and contributed interaction details when designs were incomplete or needed
                    adjustments.
                    I also partnered with the staffing team — building components for their project and assisting with
                    design
                    reviews — which helped keep UI patterns and expectations aligned across product areas. I frequently
                    acted as a
                    UI/UX sounding board for other frontend engineers, joining quick calls to walk through features,
                    review
                    visuals, and suggest refinements so things felt cohesive across projects. My focus throughout was
                    keeping the
                    experience clear, consistent, and usable as the product expanded.

                    to features
                    across iOS, Android, and web. Collaborated with designers and backend engineers to ship

                    establish UI patterns that the team continued using as the product grew. Promoted to UX Engineer

                    Full-stack development using PHP, SQL, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I worked on a variety of product
                    features, data tools,
                    and internal systems, improving legacy codebases and solving customer-reported issues. I also helped
                    implement
                    security
                    fixes and quality-of-life improvements across different parts of the platform. It was my first
                    experience working
                    within
                    a larger engineering group and collaborating across multiple teams to ship stable, production-ready
                    software.
